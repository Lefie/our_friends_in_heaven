# our_friends_in_heaven
This is a frontend project using basic html, css and javascript to help both you and me to learn more about our friends in Heaven in a digital format. Our friends in Heaven are typically referred to by the Catholic Church as the `saints`.

When I first heard of the word 'saint' before I was a practicing catholic, I thought of a human who is glowing with a halo over their head. I thought that they were so holy that they are out of reach. I find them unrelatable. But after learning more about them, their lives and their stories, I realized that they are humans just like us and they struggled just like us when they were living in the world. Each saint has a unique story and a unique friendship with God, which truly manifests God's creativity at being our Creator.

Here is one of my favorite stories about St.Teresa of Avila. St.Teresa of Avila once was on her way to establish a monastery when she fell from her horse onto the muddy ground. She complained to God about putting obstacles in her way and God told her not to complain. She famously responded "If this is how you treat your friends, it is no wonder you have so few!" 

Why is this one of my favorite stories you might ask ? Because St.Teresa talked to God like how she would talk to a best friend when they did something that pissed her off. She had no filter with God. 

Anyway, thanks for following along and I hope to introduce you to as many friends as possible through this little project.
